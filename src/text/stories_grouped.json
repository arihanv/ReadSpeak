Huzza! cried the Court and the little Princess laughed with pleasure."}, {"733": "I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the Rocket no doubt that is what it means, and he looked more supercilious than ever."}, {"734": "The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy."}, {"735": "This is evidently a deputation, said the Rocket I will receive them with becoming dignity so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject."}, {"736": "But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away."}, {"737": "Then one of them caught sight of him. Hallo! he cried, what a bad rocket!"}, {"738": "and he threw him over the wall into the ditch. BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket?"}, {"739": "he said, as he whirled through the air impossible!

Conversation, indeed! said the Rocket."}, {"761": "You have talked the whole time yourself. That is not conversation."}, {"762": "Somebody must listen, answered the Frog, and I like to do all the talking myself."}, {"763": "It saves time, and prevents arguments.

What a curious shape you are!"}, {"786": "May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?"}, {"787": "It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, otherwise you would know who I am."}, {"788": "However, I excuse your ignorance. It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself."}, {"789": "You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."}, {"790": "I dont think much of that, said the Duck, as I cannot see what use it is to any one."}, {"791": "Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the colliedog, that would be something."}, {"792": "My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, I see that you belong to the lower orders."}, {"793": "A person of my position is never useful.

Oh!"}, {"798": "dear no, cried the Rocket. I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor."}, {"799": "The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.

Ah!"}, {"809": "the higher things of life, how fine they are!"}, {"810": "said the Duck and that reminds me how hungry I feel and she swam away down the stream, saying, Quack, quack, quack."}, {"811": "Come back! come back!"}, {"812": "screamed the Rocket, I have a great deal to say to you but the Duck paid no attention to him."}, {"813": "I am glad that she has gone, he said to himself, she has a decidedly middleclass mind and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle"}, {"814": "This must be the deputation, said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified. Hallo!"}, {"815": "cried one of the boys, look at this old stick!"}, {"816": "I wonder how it came here and he picked the rocket out of the ditch. OLD Stick!"}, {"817": "said the Rocket, impossible!

Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder. There was no doubt about it."}, {"831": "But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep."}, {"832": "Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch."}, {"833": "Good heavens! cried the Goose.
